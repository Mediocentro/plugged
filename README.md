Major Project Repository with website

-----------------
**Meters**

- Consumer End Points
- Click on the individual Consumers to find their last month data + current data (if that is available to us)
- Green Map Marker (with circle in the middle) = Currently Active 
- White Map Marker (with circle in the middle) = Currently Disabled/Inactive
- Red Map Marker (with circle in the middle) and Bouncing Animation = Suspected/Detected Theft at the Consumer End Point

-----------------
**Nodes**

- The intermediate points in the single line diagram
- Need to incorporate functionalities such as enabling/disabling node - should effect all the users under the same node
- Again the same notation as Meters, except maybe no bouncing animation and would be represented by small rectangular icons.

-----------------
**Transformers**

- The final connection point from substation to the rest of the power system network
- Would have similar functionalities as the others, and would also most definitely incorporate the live tracking element
- Don't know about the symbol here yet. (Temporarily using the T symbol provided by Google)

------------------
**Substations**

- Would probably be the first thing to appear on the map (to optimize the loading and all)
- Don't know about the symbol yet.
- After selecting one of the substations the user would be shown the connection diagram inside the area of that substation.
